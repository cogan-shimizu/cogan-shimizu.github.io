# Welcome
I am an Assistant Professor at [Wright State University](https://wright.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/computer-science-and-engineering) where I direct the [Knowledge and Semantic Technologies (KASTLE) Lab](https://kastle.cs.wright.edu/). 

Previously, I was a member the Data Semantics Laboratory and completed my M.S. and Ph.D. under the supervision of [Dr. Pascal Hitzler](https://pascal-hitzler.de/). In addition, I participated in the [Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade](https://enslaved.org) and [KnowWhereGraph](https://knowwheregraph.org/) projects as a postdoctoral researcher.

My research spans the entire spectrum of the ontology development pipeline, essentially examining first the pre-conditions for constructing well-founded ontologies all the way through their use in downstream tasks, such as embeddings or machine learning.

## Research Interests
